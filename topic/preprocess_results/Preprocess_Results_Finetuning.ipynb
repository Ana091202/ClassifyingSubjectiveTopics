Very valuable on a small scale (including mienskip) and that certainly in combination with climate and reuse. Local initiatives can also lead to fragmentation while electricity must always be available, and inefficiencies.\n",
      "I assign points to both \"The municipality takes the lead and unburdens\" and to \"Residents do it themselves\". This seems contradictory, and it is. Nevertheless, I also think the residents' own initiative is important. For support, for social cohesion, but also for management. A local cooperative will be able to supply energy significantly cheaper than a commercial party. I have a hesitation about sustainability. People move, neighborhoods change, engagement can become less. To what extent can a cooperative guarantee that everyone always has access to energy?\n",
      "Given the installation of wind turbines in IJsselmeer, it would increase the effectiveness of this form of energy generation if efficient storage can take place.\n",
      "Coordination and distribution over the entire municipality As an independent party, the municipality can make the choice between the interests of individuals and residential communities\n",
      "I would like to see a large field of solar panels, worn by the inhabitants themselves, paid for by the inhabitants themselves, the moment a resident leaves for the area he should be able to sell his part back, new residents should also be able to buy a part. In this way, you as a municipality become self-sufficient while it is affordable for the vast majority of residents. Residents who would not be able to participate financially, must be able to use the solar energy, as they currently purchase electricity from their supplier.\n",
      "With more storage, more energy can perhaps be stored at peak times that can be used at another time. (i.e. ultimately generate less in total capacity)\n",
      "Here I have given 10 points. A fairly large wind farm is already coming near me, between Zurich and Witmarsum. I think that's enough for Súdwest-Fryslân. The idea of making Súdwest-Fryslân the supplier of the Netherlands seems to me to be a bad idea. We have wind here, so let's limit ourselves to windmills. Then other parts of the country can invest in large-scale solar parks with less wind. Please share the burden.\n",
      "The market is not a reliable partner. The yield is important and nature and the environment are secondary, if damage occurs there then so be it. Until now, the working method was as just described. Perhaps the municipality can play a coercive role in this and only cooperate with market parties if the damage is 0 or repaired as much as possible at the expense of the market party.\n",
      "With this proposal it is of course difficult because you have to have so many enerie generators. So I actually think this is a difficult statement, but I think the idea of helping certain parts of the Netherlands through sustainable energy is a good idea that needs to be used more.\n",
      "We have the space in the countryside to generate more than we consume. We owe our entire polder country to wind energy. The wind is nice here. Let's do more than our part here. They are opportunities. A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape. But let the profits descend locally. People have been given a little more to spend, e.g. for sustainable products, which are now slightly more expensive. Living and building land is far too expensive in Ned. Too much money is being knocked out of people's pockets for housing. Because of these high costs, the willingness to invest in sustainability is lower than in the surrounding countries.\n",
      "Both residents and the municipalities cannot fulfil the task of the RES together, so a small part will be filled by market parties, but the region will decide/benefit from such projects.\n",
      "We do not want to become a wind turbine or solar park, or biomass digester for the whole of the Netherlands.\n",
      "The (living) situation is different for everyone. However, anyone who is willing to contribute to it should be encouraged.\n",
      "I don't think you can leave this entirely to the inhabitants. But in my view, private initiatives should be possible.\n",
      "This statement makes it as if Friesland has to do it alone, while it is precisely nationally that sustainable use must be made. It is precisely cooperation with all provinces that is good because the statement can then become: \"Become an energy supplier to EU surrounding countries.\"\n",
      "In many cases, the market will determine what comes. However, this is a task for the municipal administration to keep control of whether plans and products are also sustainable and profitable for the municipality.\n",
      "Residents can take care of solar panels, heat pumps, etc. POSSIBLY WITH THE HELP OF GOOD FINANCING PROGRAMS.\n",
      "Better the municipality than a higher government like the province or The Hague. Keep it close to the citizen.\n",
      "I don't see anything in this. The landscape is helped to the sodemieter while Súdwest-Fryslân is a tourist-oriented municipality. This is therefore, in my view, a stupid and self-defeating idea.\n",
      "This would be a very good option because the inhabitants can then make their own choices. However, it can also become a mess. So there is a need for direction and frameworks from the province. The costs also influence the choices and most residents have little insight into this.\n",
      "Is an important element because it allows self-use to be further stimulated. In my opinion, essential. Furthermore, biomass and pallet stoves should be removed from the package as soon as possible. Then rather nuclear energy as a transition!\n",
      "Given the impact of the measures, right behind the front door, it seems better to put the control in the hands of municipalities and residents. The market can go out.\n",
      "The best way to guarantee that everyone is supplied with electricity green and reliably is to control everything centrally.\n",
      "Not a good plan! Generating far too much energy in our municipality to provide parts of the country with energy. See point 5!\n",
      "Can keep the balance between peaple - planet - profit. Although it will soon be in their favor. That is why good agreements must be made with the municipality.\n",
      "Clustering can be done in places licensed by the municipality, creating at least sufficient capacity for all residents, possibly with the exception of energy guzzlers, from whom own initiative can be expected.\n",
      "I do see something in solar panels on roofs where that is possible This does not affect the landscape and leaves pasture that is now sometimes used intact.  Gemeentee leeuwarden surrounds the stat with solar panels: madness\n",
      "People must be included and have confidence in the investments they (will) make. In addition, it is important that there is an organization that has expertise and keeps an overview and can combine smartly.   By making agreements with suppliers, the price can also be kept low.\n",
      "Large scale will stop growing as soon as there is a balance between supply and demand and maintenance and service is cheaper to carry out because these are concentrated locations. Service companies will establish themselves there and thus avoid long/expensive driving times for mechanics.\n",
      "should remain possible if there are good ideas/places. Here the municipality must protect the people, if necessary.\n",
      "Then it can be done on a small scale. Zosls solar panels on industrial buildings and stables and ksn everyone decides for himself what he wants.\n",
      "Scaling up results in cost savings. It is also possible to look at locations where little to no infringement is made and landscape pollution is spared most citizens. Of course, a moral consideration must be made to spare flora and fauna. The goal of improving the quality of life should not be lost sight of here either. Centralized generation can be combined with centralized storage to reduce transportation loss.\n",
      "What do I have to imagine??? A battery of 20 hectares 6 meters into the air?   Again, if I have to, that's not going to happen.   I moved here because of the beautiful landscape. We shouldn't spoil that.\n",
      "Storage is important but I see more of a decentralized advantage. You can use what you save later. Incentive to cut back\n",
      "Not every resident is equally able. It is important that everyone can participate. In addition, it is also important that the municipality remains in control. After all, it is a balancing of all (social) interests.\n",
      "Most of the inhabitants are (hopefully) calculating citizens. A lot of little bits at 90,000 inhabitants make one big one.  But you have to encourage that. Stimulate behavioural change, but also ensure that individual investments pay for themselves. Or group investments.   Since investments must also pay off here, it would be best to provide risk-bearing loans to collective efforts by cooperatives.  Do set strict requirements for landscape pollution. . So not that every village will soon have a huge village mill or a solar farm. There are still so many roofs that can be covered with solar panels...\n",
      "Personally, we have been for about 50 years, supplying gas for little money. The northern provinces have not improved, but they have remained healthier and more natural. I think it will be at the expense of our living environment, because municipality and politics, then will start thinking, in the north there is a lot of grazing land left . Go ahead. I am 100% opposed to that. Use buildings. In percentage terms, it does not represent anything we place on buildings, but in meadows this becomes far too large. Mistake of politics, province and municipality. Money wolves.\n",
      "Generating in the peak can be used for off-peak moments. In the nitrogen plant in Groningen, the region is focusing on this from the Regional Energy Strategy (RES).\n",
      "The market works fine if there is a consumer who is critical and there is sufficient competition. Letting the market determine means that the strongest lobby wins, which does not necessarily have to be the best solution. The choice must lie with the residents. So certainly not a forced shopping with faits accomplis / choices that are later a bit disappointing.\n",
      "Not every farmer has a windmill, but concentrated in places where it is the least disfiguring of the landscape.\n",
      "Windmills are out of the question. The municipal area where they can be placed without causing nuisance is too small for this. Also too dependent on weather conditions. Solar parks are better in that respect because the same solar panels can also be placed on their homes for residents. If a system that is as uniform as possible is chosen here, this can save a lot on purchasing and maintenance, for all parties.\n",
      "This is where the biggest blow has to be made, there is enough generation but with peaks and valleys, there is a great need for storage to level that capriciousness. We do look at efficiency, costs / benefits, sustainability and adaptability. Working with a displacement sequence. The use of, for example, water level differences, underground storage, etc.\n",
      "I also like it when people see for themselves what they can do in the backyard themselves with, for example, a small windmill.\n",
      "Yes, now we generate our own energy. We already drive an electric car, cook electric, etc. But.... We (mainly) only generate energy when the sun is shining. In order to become completely independent of any electricity company, it would be nice if there would be a solution to store energy, so that we can link supply and demand by means of storage. So it's important!\n",
      "If the municipality takes the lead, there will not be large energy parks everywhere. but it can be distributed more among the inhabitants. Together we are big!\n",
      "If we can generate more than other regions, we can supply to those other regions, provided, of course, that we can continue to meet our own energy needs. That's primary.\n",
      "Science and technology, in collaboration with commercial stakeholders, need a free hand, space to develop new techniques and, for example, to develop pilot projects, such as those set up in Groningen with the hydrogen project to connect houses to hydrogen via the natural gas network and to use that hydrogen as a storage medium for generated green electricity and, for example, to also run cars and buses on it.\n",
      "As long as a shortage still exists, it must be filled. This point will be removed as the municipality takes up its role more actively.\n",
